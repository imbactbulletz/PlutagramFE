Current issues:
  Frontend:
    - Hamburger menu appears when elements are empty (tried hiding it with @ViewChild but it cannot resolve module in which Navbar resides)
  Backend:
    - Remove unused imports (Base64Encoder)
    - Handle failed login (Currently server returns 500 because it can't find user based on credentials)
Questions:
  - Why is there a logout on backend? (Probably so he can send a logout message to back end when logging out)
  - Should more than one user with the same email address be allowed to register? (Currently, n users with same email can register)
