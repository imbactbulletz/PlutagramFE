Current issues:
  Frontend:
    - Hamburger menu appears when elements are empty (tried hiding it with @ViewChild but it cannot resolve module in which Navbar resides)
  Backend:
    - Remove unused imports (Base64Encoder)

Questions:
  - Why is there a logout on backend? Why can't just token expire after a certain time on frontend?
